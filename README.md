## Usage

When launched, this app will start your currently defined screen saver as the background image. If it is already running, this will switch back to the static image.

This uses a lot of energy and should not be used on battery. But really, you should not waste energy on this altogether.

## Deprecation notice

Works until Mac OS X 10.8 or so.
